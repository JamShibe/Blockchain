# Blockchain
A simple blockchain node I made by following a guide in order to develop my understanding of blockchains

Guide I followed:

The blockchain has a simple method for mining and managing transactions.
It also includes a simple Proof of Work algorithm and a consensus algorithm to support multiple nodes
